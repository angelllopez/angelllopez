### Web Development Project:
#### [UtiliSense](https://github.com/angelllopez/UtiliSense2)
- The project is an ASP.NET Core 8 Web API app that uses the latest features and best practices of the framework.
- The project's main goal is to provide a secure and reliable way of sharing the historical energy production data of my Sun Power's Equinox 11.90 kW system with authorized client applications.
- The historical data spans from the date when the system was activated until the most recent Sun Power's Monthly Performance Report, which is updated every month.
- The project exposes a RESTful API that supports CRUD operations on the historical data, as well as authentication and authorization mechanisms based on OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect standards.
- The project also includes a Swagger UI documentation that describes the API endpoints, parameters, responses and examples.
- The project is developed using Visual Studio 2022 and follows the SOLID principles, clean architecture and test-driven development methodologies.
